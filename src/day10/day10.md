10. Fine-Grained Locking: Multiple Shared Resources
    Why learn:
    Minimizes unnecessary blocking, letting multiple threads update different resources at the same time.

Real-world use:

Database servers: Concurrent updates to different tables or rows.

E-commerce: One thread updates orders, another manages payment, a third handles notifications.

OS file systems: Allowing different files to be accessed/updated in parallel.

Critical skill:
Efficient concurrency unlocks the full power of multi-core processors, letting your apps scaleâ€”and feel fast and responsive under pressure.

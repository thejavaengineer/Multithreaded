9. Volatile Signaling Between Threads: Special Board
   Why learn:
   Flags that are reliably visible to all threads are the backbone of safe, efficient inter-thread communication for simple status signaling.

Real-world use:

Download managers: Flag “download complete” to trigger next step.

Schedulers: Mark work as “ready” or “done” between worker threads.

Real-time analytics: Signal data freshness.

Critical skill:
Knowing where volatile is enough—and when you need something more powerful (like locks)—lets you write succinct and effective code.

1. Basic Thread: Chef and Waiter Working Simultaneously
   Why learn:
   Multi-threading enables a single program to run several operations at once—essential for performance and user experience.

Real-world use:

A chat app: receive messages while typing.

A server: handles data processing and network requests in parallel.

Any app that shouldn’t freeze the UI while doing a background task.

Critical skill:
All modern computers and phones use multi-threading to stay responsive and fast. Almost any professional Java app uses this for some part of its logic.

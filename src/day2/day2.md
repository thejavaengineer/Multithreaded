2. Waiter Waiting for Chef (Thread Coordination / Join)
   Why learn:
   Some tasks must occur in a specific order; coordination prevents chaos from "everyone going at once".

Real-world use:

A photo editor: Waits for file to load before applying filters.

E-commerce: Confirms inventory is checked before finalizing a purchase.

Finance: Batch jobs that must process steps in sequence.

Critical skill:
Coordinating threads avoids bugs, crashes, or incomplete outputsâ€”vital in anything with tasks that depend on each other.
